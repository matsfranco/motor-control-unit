# motor-control-unit

This projects implements a firmware for Arduino Nano with ATMega328P to control a pair of DC motors using common Radiocontrollers.
Basically it implements two adjustables PID controllers for precise rotational speed control using PPM pulses from a Radiocontroler receiver.
The libraries were developed base on Andrew Kramer library, available at http://andrewjkramer.net/pid-motor-control/
